Roadmap/TODO for V1.0:
- Add ability to trade in duplicate TMs to black market for credit
- Redefine trainer classes and give proper money reward values
- Standardize all maps with proper tilesets
- Seafoam Island boulder puzzle
- Trainer rematches/phone system
- Respawning item systems e.g. berries in berry forest, beach items
- Define wild pokemon held items past gen 1
- Special NPCs need proper overworld sprites i.e. Ariana and Archer
- Sprites for animated trainer intros
- Add proper VS sprites
- Sprites for key items (everything after OldSeaMap in PBS)
- TMs need descriptions (fixed in v22?)
- Custom title screen, credits images
- Dynamax and tera plugin settings
- Update Follower plugin to include gen 9 data (low prio, fix in v22?)
- Events that display a pokemon image need to be fixed. Intro cutscene (move events too), fuchsia zoo, pallet town starters, ss anne snorlax guy, other gifts, etc
- TM Vendor event is hardcoded to not allow numbers above 360 (how to make dynamic?)
	- Additionally, add a way to trade in duplicate TMs for credit?
- Roamers? (v22, if ever)

Where should you be working? If you're editting:
- Map Data Files
- encounters PBS
- map_connections PBS
- map_metadata PBS

ONLY make these changes within your region's project. 
If your work is finalized, you MUST compile your project afterwards, and copy these things to Full Game, in the relevant Data\disc# folder
- Maps
- encounters.dat
- map_connections.dat
- map_metadata.dat



If you want to edit:
- System settings
- Scripts
- Plugins
- Sprites or other graphics
- Tilesets
- Audio files
- Other, 'global' PBS files
- Any other 'global' data

Then you MUST perform these changes within the Global project, and ensure that your changes are properly copied to Full Game AND other region projects. 
Failure to follow these guidelines will cause projects to desync.

What to push to Main without exception? If you edit:
- Map Data Files
- encounters PBS
- map_connections PBS
- map_metadata PBS

The region's project MUST be compiled, and you MUST commit these things to Main, in the relevant Data\disc# folder
- Maps
- encounters.dat
- map_connections.dat
- map_metadata.dat


If you edit:
- System settings
- Scripts
- Plugins
- Sprites or other graphics
- Tilesets
- Audio files
- PBS files
- Any other 'global' data

Then you MUST ensure that your changes are properly commited to Main AND other region branches. Otherwise projects will desync.
It is far easier to make global changes on Main so that all branches can pull them.

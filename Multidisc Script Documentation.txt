# ** Disc Changer script (Designed for Legend of Harpine)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Zeriab
# 1.05
# 2008-09-20
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Allows you to change the disc, where each disc can contain 999 maps
#==============================================================================
=begin
INSTRUCTIONS
------------
If you do not have the SDK then you have to change Game_Map
In the Game_Map setup method change the load_data line to this: (Line 50)

  # Load map from file and set @map
  @map = load_data(sprintf("Data/%sMap%03d.rxdata", $game_system.disc, @map_id))

After you have done this the below will work.

This script enables the change_disc command. Use script calls to change the disc.
For disc 1 create a subfolder in your data folder called 'disc1' and place the
map files for disc 1 in there.
For disc 2 you should create a subfolder called 'disc2' and place the map files
for disc 2 in there. And so on for each of your discs.
The syntax is:

  change_disc(number, id = nil, x = nil, y = nil, direction = nil)

The nil numbers mean that those arguments are optional. When you don't use them
then they are set to whatever the current map_id, x, y and direction are at the
moment.

If you want to change to disc 2 then you can put this in a script call:

  change_disc(2)
  
You will then be transferred to disc 2 with the same map id and coordinates as
what the player currently has.
If you want to be more precise and say you want to change to disc 2 on the map
with id 10 and the player must be placed at the tile with x = 6 and y = 13 then
you should put this in a call script:

  change_disc(2, 10, 6, 13)
  
Note that when you start the game the maps directly in the data folder is used.
You can back to them by changing to disc number 0.
Basically, disc number 0 is the maps directly in the data folder and not in any
of the sub folders.

The final argument is the direction. By default the player retains the current
direction. You can put 6 different values as direction:

0, 10 : No change
2     : Turn Down
4     : Turn Left
6     : Turn Right
8     : Turn Up

If you for example want to transfer the player to disc 1, map 43 at x = 30 and
y = 4 with the player looking down you should put this in a call script:

  change_disc(1, 43, 30, 4, 2)

Core Systems
- Add 'debug' scripts for the regional storage merge functions. Currently, there is no way to proceed if a player (somehow) has a full storage when these are triggered
- Define wild pokemon held items past gen 1
- Dynamax and tera plugin settings (verify these are correct)
- Update Follower plugin to include gen 9 data (low prio, fix in v22?)
- Roamers? (v22, if ever)
- You can't do trade evolutions where you need to trade a mon for a mon, such as karablast (fixed in v22)
- TM black market event is hardcoded to not allow numbers above 360 (how to make dynamic?)
	- Add ability to trade in duplicate TMs to black market for credit
KANTO
- Gamefreak diploma NPC is currently hard coded instead of calling for each number of species in a dex dynamically


Feature Complete
- Respawning item systems e.g. berries in berry forest, beach items
- Redefine trainer classes and give proper money reward values
- Trainer rematches/phone system
- Seafoam Island boulder puzzle
- Sprites for key items (everything after OldSeaMap in PBS)
- TMs need descriptions (fixed in v22?)
- All mail item functionality is missing
KANTO
- Teachy TV tutorial is nonfunctional
- Selphy's requests are not coded
- Missing functionality for Saffron Fan Club, Berry powder guy, badge description guy in cerulean, Sticker npc on four island, heracross measurer on six island, magikarp guy on route 12
- Lavender Tower ghost system unimplemented; an NPC stopgap is in place for now
- Some TMs and items are unobtainable due to generational differences - i.e., TM07 Horn Drill can't be obtained as it was replaced in the gen 3 celadon mart, protector has no sources as this is not gen 4 kanto, etc.
	- Changes to canon content should be kept minimal when solving this issue
	- Items should be held by wild pokemon that can evolve using them, i.e. Protector on Rhyhorn/Rhydon, Magmarizer on Magmar, etc.
	- Exceptions should be made at best judgement and must fit established lore, I.e., the Up-Grade for Porygon was moved to Silph Co. from the Rocket Warehouse, with the Dubious Disc replacing the spawn in the Rocket Warehouse

Cosmetic
- Standardize all maps with proper tilesets
- Special NPCs need proper overworld sprites i.e. Ariana and Archer

	- Intro cutscene does not have the Nidoran coming out of a pokeball animation while Oak remains loaded
- No Fame Checker in Cerulean; most fame checker lore events are missing around the world.
